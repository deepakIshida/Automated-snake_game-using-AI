# Automated-snake_game-using-AI\
Developed an automated version of the classic Snake Game using Python and the Turtle graphics library. Integrated a simple AI system that dynamically calculates the best and safest path to the food while avoiding collisions with walls and the snakeâ€™s own body.
Key Skills Used:
-Python Programming
-Turtle Graphics (GUI)
-Game Logic & Loops
-Collision Detection
-Basic AI & Path Planning
-Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This project strengthened my understanding of game development fundamentals, coordinate geometry, and basic decision-making algorithms in Python.
